// I believe that syntax is the "grammar" of coding. ";" means "." for example. 
// "{ }" represent a paragraph. 
// Classes are like pages or page numbers to help locate paragraphs. 
// Functions are the content of the paragraphs. 

// However, functions act like order forms given to soldiers. If you create a function, the
// soldiers know what to do when you say a code word. When you call a function, the soldiers 
// (who have read your orders) do what you instructed. 

// I think that's all I've learned so far... am I missing something?
